A stunning, lightweight Task Manager built with a **Glassmorphism** UI aesthetic. It features smooth orbital animations, local storage persistence, and a focus-driven interface.

## ✨ Features

* **Glassmorphism UI**: Frosted glass effects using `backdrop-filter` and semi-transparent borders.
* **Persistent Data**: Tasks are saved automatically to your browser's `localStorage` — never lose your list on refresh.
* **Smart Filtering**: Toggle between **All**, **Active**, and **Completed** tasks instantly.
* **Smooth Animations**:
    * Background floating orbs with distinct orbital paths.
    * Satisfying slide-in/slide-out animations for task creation and deletion.
    * Gradient shifting background.
* **Task Limits**: Prevents clutter by capping tasks at 999 entries.
* **Responsive**: Fully optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Core**: Semantic HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Styling**: Custom CSS for glass effects + TailwindCSS (via CDN) for utility classes.
* **Fonts**: 'Poppins' from Google Fonts for a clean, modern typography.

## 🚀 Quick Start

You don't need to install anything! This is a pure static application.

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash

    ```

## 🎨 Design System

The application uses a specific gradient palette to achieve the "Deep Space" glass look:

* **Background**: Linear gradient shifting between `#667eea`, `#764ba2`, `#f093fb`, and `#4facfe`.
* **Glass Cards**: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)` with a 20px blur.
* **Typography**: Poppins (Weights: 300, 400, 500, 600, 700).
